---

## 5. Database Design

The system uses a relational database design with MySQL to ensure data integrity and efficient querying.

[42]

### 5.1 Database Schema

The database consists of several interconnected tables:

**Core Tables:**

- `customers` - Customer-specific details
- `employees` - Staff information and roles
- `rooms` - Room inventory and specifications
- `bookings` - Reservation records
- `payments` - Financial transactions
- `check_ins` - Check-in records
- `check_outs` - Check-out records

### 5.2 Entity Relationships

**Key Relationships:**
- One-to-Many: Customer → Bookings
- One-to-Many: Room → Bookings
- One-to-One: Booking → Payment
- Many-to-One: Bookings → Employee (Manager)

### 5.3 Database Configuration

The database connection is managed through the `DBConnection.java` class:

```java
public class DBConnection {
    public static final String DB_NAME = "mydatabase";
    public static final String USERNAME = "myuser";
    public static final String PASSWORD = "myuserpassword";
    
    public static Connection getConnections() {
        // Database connection implementation
    }
}
```
